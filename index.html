                        <p class="lead">In today's digital age, passwords are an essential part of our lives. We use them to access our bank accounts, email, social media, and countless other online services. 
                                        With so many passwords to remember, it's no wonder that many people resort to using simple and easy-to-guess passwords or reusing the same password across multiple accounts. 
                                        While convenient, this kind of practice poses a huge security risk to the user. However, this can easily be mitigated with the use of a password manager.</p>

                        <h2>What is a Password Manager?</h2>
                        <p class="lead">A password manager is a software or service that securely stores and manages all of your passwords. Instead of having to remember each individual password, you only need to remember one master password to access all of the passwords stored in your virtual vault. Using a password manager has several benefits:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Password Strength:</b> Since you only have to remember one password, you can make all of your passwords extremely strong and difficult to guess, without having to worry about forgetting them.</li>
                            <li><b>Auto-Fill:</b> Most modern password managers have auto-fill capabilities, which means that they can attach themselves to your browser and instantaneously fill in a website's login fields for you at the press of a button.</li>
                            <li><b>Biometrics:</b> If the device you're using supports biometrics such as fingerprint scanning, a password manager can use that to authenticate you, saving you from having to type in your master password every time you use your device. This combined with auto-fill can even potentially protect you from keylogging attacks, since you won't be typing in anything!</li>
                            <li><b>Sharing:</b> Higher-end password managers also allow you to securely share your logins with other users. This is incredibly important, as it can be relatively easy for someone to intercept email, text, and other common communication methods that one might use to share passwords.</li>
                            <li><b>Screening:</b> The best password management services will even compare your stored passwords to ones leaked in recent data breaches, alerting you to any potential danger if they find a match.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p class="lead">I want to make it absolutely clear that I am <b>NOT</b> implying in any way that password managers are a perfect solution to online security, or that using one will make you immune to attacks. In fact, if used improperly, they can make you even <i>more</i> vulnerable (I'll go over best practices shortly). What I <i>do</i> mean to say is that unless you have an amazing memory and already use a separate strong password for all of your different services, then using a password manager is going to be more convenient and more secure than whatever you're currently doing. There's no such thing as a perfect solution, but for the vast majority of people a password manager is leagues better than the alternatives.</p>

                        <h2>Your Master Password</h2>
                        <p class="lead">First things first, <i>your master password needs to be strong.</i> Like, ridiculously strong. It's the only password you have to remember and the key to all the others, you can afford to go a little overboard. This begs the question, "how can I create a password that is both strong and easy to remember?" There are many methods you can use, but my favorite is using acronyms. To do this, start with a quote, scripture, verse, or similarly sized text (20-30 words should be perfect). Then, replace each word with its first letter, remove the spaces, and you have your new password!</p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="lead">Here's an example: let's take Psalms 24:4, a popular verse from the bible. The original text is: "Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me." First, we replace each word with its first letter. Now we have "Y, t I w t t v o t s o d, I w f n e: f t a w m; t r a t s t c m." Next we remove the spaces, giving us "Y,tIwttvotsod,Iwfne:ftawm;tratstcm." For a final added touch, we can add "23:4" and a space to the beginning, referencing the chapter and verse. Now we have: <br><br>23:4 Y,tIwttvotsod,Iwfne:ftawm;tratstcm. <br><br> This is a ridiculously strong password that includes at least one character of each type. In fact, if we plug it into a password strength meter such as <a href="https://www.passwordmonster.com/" target="_blank">passwordmonster.com</a>, we are told that it would take approximately "97 thousand trillion trillion trillion trillion years" to crack it forcefully. In spite of this, we can remember it easily by reciting the scripture in our head as we type.</p>

                        <h2>Best Practices When Using a Password Manager</h2>
                        <p class="lead">Here are a few suggestions to maximize security while using a password manager:<br><br>
                            <b>Don't use it to manage your email login.</b> In the unlikely event that you get locked out of your vault, the only way you'll be able to reset most of your passwords is with your email. So, it's best to manage it seperately, preferably with a password just as strong as the one you use for your password manager. <br><br>
                            <b>Use Multi-Factor Authentication.</b> Any password manager worth mentioning will let you use an authenticator device or mobile app in addition to your master password for accessing your vault. Use it. You typically only have to do this the first time you log in on a given device, so it's really not that much extra hassle, but it provides so much extra protection. In the event that someone gets their hands on your master password they still won't be able to access your vault unless they also have physical access to one of your devices. Click <a href="https://bitwarden.com/blog/basics-of-two-factor-authentication-with-bitwarden/" target="_blank">here</a> to learn more about MFA.<br><br>
                            <b>Use Timeouts.</b> Configure your password manager so that it will only stay unlocked for a certain amount of time after authorization. This will prevent anyone from accessing your vault if you leave your computer unattended. If you have biometric authentication enabled, you should set the timer to lock your vault after just a minute or two, given that it will only take you a second to unlock it again.</p>

                        <h2>So... Which One Should I Use??? </h2>
                        <p class="lead">While I am by no means an expert in this field, my personal recommendation to anyone wanting to try using a password manager for the first time would be <a href="https://bitwarden.com/products/personal/" target="_blank">Bitwarden.</a> Out of all the password managers I've researched and tried, Bitwarden is by far the best. They use military-grade encryption and a zero-knowledge architecture, meaning that Bitwarden doesn't even know what your master password is, and they only store encrypted versions of your passwords on their servers. That way, even if someone hacked their servers, the attacker wouldn't be able to access your passwords without cracking your master password first. Bitwarden also offers excellent compatability accross various devices including smartphones, meaning that you can even use it to log into mobile apps. More than anything else however, I recommend Bitwarden because it offers a free plan that includes almost everything you could ask for, or if you're willing to pay they offer everything else for just $10 a year (most competitors charge $36 anually).</p>

                        <p class="lead">Using a password manager is something anyone can do with a little practice, and doing so can greatly increase the quality of one's digital life, especially when it comes to peace of mind. As such, I would recommend that everyone use a password manager. (Just remember to excercise best practices!)</p>
